# Mine Grinder Official Book Website

A website built in React and Typescript.

## Getting Started
Simply go to [http://www.minegrinder.com](http://www.minegrinder.com) to be directed to the home page.

## Jumpscare
A marketing gag, the website is equipped with a function that users can opt out of where after 5 minutes the users will be warned that the "Grinder" is coming. Randomly afterwards, the user will be redirected to a jumpscare animation of the book's antagonist, and then be redirected again to the main page.
